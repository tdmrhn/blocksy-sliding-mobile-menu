Custom sliding mobile menu, only works for Content Blocks > WP Core Navigation Block (add ct-sliding class)


Hey there! ðŸŒŸ To give your website that extra pop with a mobile tabbed menu using Blocksy 2 Premium, Tabs Block, and the magic of a custom plugin, follow these steps:

    Get Your Tools Ready: Make sure you have Blocksy 2 Premium installed, and a Tabs Block along with the necessary custom plugin.
    Craft Your Mobile Tabbed Menu: I used the GreenShift Tab Block for this and added the WP Core  Navigation block. Set the orientation to vertical and turned off the overlay menu.
    Add Some Flair: Inject some style by adding the "ct-sliding" class to your WP Core Navigation block. You can check out the video for a visual guide.
    Publish with Pride: Once you've created your masterpiece, hit that publish button on the Content Block.
    Customizer Magic: Head over to Customizer > Header > Tablet/Mobile Menu. Add the Content Block element, select your creation, and throw in any other elements you want. Hit publish again in the customizer to make it official!

And voilÃ ! Your mobile tabbed menu is now ready to dazzle your visitors. Don't forget to add extra elements to make it uniquely yours.
Oh, and about that custom plugin? It's the secret sauce that brings the sliding menu feature to life for the "ct-sliding" class. Just ensure it's doing its magic behind the scenes.
